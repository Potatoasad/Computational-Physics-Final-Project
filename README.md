# Computational-Physics-Final-Project
 Final Project for the Computational Physics course at UT Austin



### Ideas

Here are the ideas we're thinking about so far:

Project ideas
	◦	Inspiral stochastic dynamics
	✓	Bayesian inference 
	◦	Differentiable ODE solver 
	✓	Finding distribution samples are coming from
	◦	Differentiable ODE solver with distribution of parameter estimation
	◦	Stochastic stuff is common interest 
	◦	Different cost functions corresponding to different measures of distance between distributions
	◦	KPZ
	✓	Imaginary time evolution and LQFT
